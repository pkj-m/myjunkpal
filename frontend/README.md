## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Backend server running on `http://localhost:8080`

### Installation

No installation required! This is a static web application.

     # Using Node.js (with http-server installed)
     npx http-server -p 3000
     ```
   - **Option 3:** Open directly in browser:
     ```bash
     open index.html  # macOS
     ```

3. **Access the app:**

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend REST API at `http://localhost:8080/api`:

### Endpoints Used

- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `GET /api/foods` - List all foods
- `POST /api/foods` - Create custom food
- `DELETE /api/foods/{id}` - Delete custom food
- `GET /api/entries` - List all entries
- `POST /api/entries` - Log new entry
- `DELETE /api/entries/{id}` - Delete entry
- `GET /api/nutrition/daily/{date}` - Get daily summary
- `GET /api/nutrition/goals` - Get nutrition goals
- `PUT /api/nutrition/goals` - Update nutrition goals

## Customization

### Changing API Base URL

Edit the `API_BASE` constant in `app.js`:

```javascript
const API_BASE = 'http://your-backend-url:port/api';
```

### Styling

All CSS is embedded in `index.html` in the `<style>` tag. Modify colors, fonts, and layouts directly there.

### Adding New Features

The code is organized by feature:
- Auth functions: `register()`, `login()`, `logout()`
- Foods functions: `loadFoods()`, `addFood()`, `deleteFood()`
- Entries functions: `loadEntries()`, `addEntry()`, `deleteEntry()`
- Dashboard functions: `loadDailySummary()`
- Goals functions: `loadGoals()`, `updateGoals()`

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge 90+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 88+
- ‚úÖ Safari 14+
- ‚úÖ Opera 76+

## Limitations

- Single user session (one user logged in at a time on the backend)
- No offline support
- Session resets when backend restarts
- No persistent authentication tokens

## Future Enhancements

Potential features to add:
- Charts and graphs for nutrition trends
- Weekly/monthly views
- Meal planning
- Barcode scanning integration
- Export data to CSV
- Dark mode toggle
- Mobile responsive design improvements
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch" errors
- Ensure backend is running on port 8080
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify API_BASE URL is correct

### No foods showing
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check that backend has `data/foods.json` populated
- Look for errors in browser console

### Can't log in
- Verify you've registered an account first
- Check that backend `data/users.json` exists
- Try registering a new account
